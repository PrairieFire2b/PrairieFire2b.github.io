# Thesis Language

{{#title Thesis Lang}}

Describe my repository __Thesis__.

## Foreward

__Thesis__ is a programming language, expected as a _meta_ language by me.

## Some backgrounds

### Origin

In the first few (actually 3) years of studying programming languages, I have never been able to accept any of one language designs completely. Out of curiosity, also to design my own programming language, I try to find out the reason and work out a solution.

The experience of finding the right start is actually a little painful. But when I got to it, I could realize the fool of the me in the past. At last, in just a few days of studying, I quickly find my real interests and become a fanboy of _PLT_.

### Development of my thoughts

Earlier, I had written a article about _What is key to design a programming language_. The article is rough, though, I still point out the importance of the consistency of syntax and semantics on my own.

In fact, before learning _PLT_, I have a few repealed designs of my own languages.But I do not have ability to complete or imply them (because they are too complex). Other than that, they are not what I expected. I am a minimalist. And, obviously, I like powerful abstractions and features but will not like things being too complex.

Later, when I first learnt about it, I was struck by its formal beauty. It's pure! And then, only be expected, I got to know about some non-industrial languages. Such as _Scheme_, _Haskell_, _Agda_.


### Conclusion

~~__No one can refuse to design & imply a programming language!__~~
